How to contribute
=================

Thank you for thinking of contributing!


Reporting issues
----------------

Include the following information in your post:

-   Describe what you expected to happen.
-   If possible, include a `minimal reproducible example`_ to help us
    identify the issue. This also helps check that the issue is not with
    your own code.
-   Describe what actually happened. Include the full traceback if there
    was an exception.

.. _minimal reproducible example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example


Submitting patches
------------------

If there is not an open issue for what you want to submit, prefer
opening one for discussion before working on a PR. You can work on any
issue that doesn't have an open PR linked to it or a maintainer assigned
to it. These show up in the sidebar. No need to ask if you can work on
an issue that interests you.

Include the following in your patch:

-   Include tests if your patch adds or changes code. Make sure the test
    fails without your patch.
-   Update any relevant docs pages and docstrings. Docs pages and
    docstrings should be wrapped at 72 characters.
-   Add an entry in ``CHANGES.rst``. Use the same style as other
    entries.
